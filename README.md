# Rustdesk-ID-Change
The script use to change the rustdesk ID. As a open source remote control software, the "once good" a software can not manually change the ID even though you have host your own ID server or relay server. That sucks, I gathered the issue in the rustdesk and paied my effort to try to fix this problem. Both Windows and Linux works (version 1.3.8)~
